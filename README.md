This is the graphical user interface for controlling TIRA (Tactile Interactive Robotic Arm) through USB serial.
The Python code is based on TKinter framework so you might need to install tkinter.
This code is open source and open for any changes.

The code receives user keyboard input.
It then sends data to the Arduino through serial.
The Arduino will read it and turn the servo motors.
